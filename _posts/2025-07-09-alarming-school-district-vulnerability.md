I recently stumbled upon a school district's website while researching something unrelated, and what I found was alarming.

My initial glance at the Google search result horrified me. I had been directed to an FTP upload site, seemingly used by the school district, that was completely open to the public without any authentication. As I quickly scanned the page, I could also see the read/write/execute permissions for each uploaded file.

I initially thought this was the extent of the security oversight. However, I later revisited the page, still grappling with the disbelief that such a vulnerability could exist, especially in 2025. Upon closer inspection, I noticed something I'd missed in the upper right-hand corner: an "Upload" button.

This was far worse than I had initially imagined. It meant anyone from the public internet could upload any file they wished directly to the school's server.

My mind immediately went to the implications of such a flaw â€“ specifically, the well-known technique of uploading malicious files and renaming them to exploit existing execute permissions. An attacker could easily gain an initial foothold.

While I'll spare the school system the embarrassment of naming them, it was truly terrifying to consider the potential for a significant breach. This serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of robust cybersecurity practices, even for seemingly safe public-facing sites.
