Welcome to my blog! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and professional. This site is a place for me to share my thoughts, discoveries, and lessons learned in the world of IT and security.

I'm currently in the process of building out a homelab, and I'll be sharing my journey and findings here. You'll find posts on topics like:

* **Homelab & IT Projects:** A dive into building out my personal lab, including setting up a **VPN**, configuring a **reverse proxy server**, and deploying tools for **remote access** and **media management**.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Deep dives into alarming vulnerabilities, like the recent school district incident.
* **AI and Privacy:** Discussions on the evolving relationship between new technologies and data privacy, like the case I documented with Gemini.
* **Ethical Hacking:** Tutorials and insights into security best practices and ethical hacking techniques.

My goal is to shed light on complex topics and help others stay informed and secure in an ever-changing digital landscape. Thanks for stopping by!
